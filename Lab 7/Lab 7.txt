Behavioral Modeling
	Initial Block -> can only be executed once 
	Always -> can be executed multiple times (Loop)

- Hardware made inside always block

Blocking Assignment -> =
- Runs sequentially
- Combinational Circuits

Non-Blocking Assignment -> <=
- Runs parallel
- Sequential Circuits

Always -> @
Combinational
- always@(a or b)
- always@(a,b) 
- always@(*) -> access input values itself

Sequential
- always@(posedge CLK , posedge RESET)

- Output in always is reg
